Interactive 2D Electric Field & Potential Simulator
<p>
This project is an interactive simulation that visualizes the electric field and electric potential created by three point charges arranged in a 2D space.
</p>
<p>
What is this about?
</p>
In physics, electric charges create forces and influence the space around them. Two important concepts to describe this are:
Electric Field: A vector field showing the direction and strength of force a positive test charge would feel at any point in space.
Electric Potential: A scalar field representing the potential energy a charge would have at any point.
This simulator helps you see these concepts by showing how three adjustable point charges affect the electric field and potential in a 2D plane.

What you see and interact with
  </p>
Visualizations Electric Field Intensity Plot (Left):
Shows the flow lines of the electric field using arrows, combined with a color map that indicates the strength (intensity) of the field at every point.
Lines point where a positive charge would be pushed or pulled.
Color shows how strong the field is (hot colors mean stronger).
Electric Potential Plot (Right):
Displays equipotential lines (lines of equal electric potential) colored from blue to red.
This shows how the potential energy varies in space around the charges.

Interactive Sliders
<p>
You can move sliders to change the position (X and Y) and magnitude (positive or negative value) of each of the three point charges.
Position sliders: Move each charge anywhere within the square area displayed (-1 to 1 on both axes).
Magnitude sliders: Change the strength and polarity of each charge (positive means a positive charge, negative means negative).
When you move these sliders, the plots update instantly so you can explore how different arrangements of charges affect the fields.
</p>
What can you learn or explore?
<p>
How changing the charge strength and location affects the electric field shape and strength.
The interaction between positive and negative charges visually.
The difference between the vector field (electric field) and the scalar field (potential).
Intuition behind fundamental electromagnetic concepts that are critical in physics and engineering.
</p>
Who is this for?
<p>
Anyone curious about physics, electromagnetism, or just wants to see cool interactive visualizations of fields. No advanced physics or math is required â€” just move the sliders and watch the changes!

How to run
<p>
This project uses Python and the ipywidgets library for interactivity. You can run it in a Jupyter Notebook environment with these steps:
Install required packages if needed:Install required packages if needed:
pip install numpy matplotlib ipywidgets
Open the script or notebook and run the code.
Use the sliders to explore.
